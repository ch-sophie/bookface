## Team collaborators:

### Mission:  
Good morning,   

If you receive this email, it means that you've been selected to carry on the development of my new (amazing) Web Platform.

I had this idea back in High school, but never had means to carry it out.

BookFace, "A place where friends can reconnect".

It's quite a simple application but I know it has the power to change the world.

The idea: When someone registers to the app, they can create a "Profile", then they can go to what I will call, their "floors", wich is a place where a user can post what they think, what they do, maybe a picture of them...

Then, they can use the space bar, to search for other persons using Bookface and check out what they posted on their floors.

I'm sure you are up for the task. you and I will shape the future together!

Zack Trurenberck.
